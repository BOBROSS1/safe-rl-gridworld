# Safe RL Gridworld
Implementation of learning agent with shields in a gridworld environment.

### Qtable implementation
* conda/pip install requirements.txt
* set parameters in file
* run: `python3 qlearning.py` (use cli command `--n=10` to set the number of experiments to run, use `-p=True` to plot directly (else only data is returned))

### Deep Q Network implementation (under construction)
* conda/pip install requirements.txt
* set parameters in file
* run: `python3 dqn.py`

### Results
The experiments are in the experiments folder as notebooks (scroll to bottom for figures).
